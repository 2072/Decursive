Always submit clean and fully commented code, if what you want to do requires big changes, ask to the author first.

TODO:

- when a mind controlled unit is sheepped we should be able to know it without having to target it and look for the sheep debuff
  (maybe just check for polymorph debuff/buff? on the target and remove the charmed bit if found)

- Let the users choose the MUF colors
  (may be useful for color-blind users)

- Mages should be able to choose what polymorf spell they want to use
  (just change the table DcrC.SpellsToUse and call Dcr:Configure();)

- Add an option to let the user choose the alert sound.

- Add an option to only show the MUF in raid or group
  (This has been requested a couple of time but I'm not very keen to do it)

- Clean up the code
- Add comments
