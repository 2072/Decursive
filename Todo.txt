
Prio TODO:

- set the MUFs to a lower level
- make it so that mages can see all Mind controlled targets in the MUFs currently they only see charmed unit with a magical debuffs.
- Add an option to change the default alpha for non-afflicted units.
- Changes unlocalized localization.LANG.lua so that [VARIABLE] = "ENGLISH TEXT" instead of [VARIABLE] = VARIABLE (Easier for translators)
- Add an online help showing the localized readme.txt file (a script on my side will have to encode-escape the text before each commit)


Other TODO:

- Add something in the readme.txt file about why Decursive changed that much and why one can no longer click in the live-list, it's a recurrent question...
- Add a border depending on the unit-class around an afflicted MUF
- Make it so that the MUFs can be ordered by Class easily.
- Change the live-list display
- Clean up the code
- Add comments
