Personal TODO file for Archarodim (will stop to be personal once I'll add comments and cleaned the code ;) )


Prio TODO:

- Add an online help showing the localized readme.txt file (a script on my side will have to encode-escape the text before each commit)


Other TODO:

- Add something in the readme.txt file about why Decursive changed that much and why one can no longer click in the live-list, it's a recurrent question...
- Add a border depending on the unit-class around an afflicted MUF
- Make it so that the MUFs can be ordered by Class easily.
- Change the live-list display
- Clean up the code
- Add comments
