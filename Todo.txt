Personal TODO file for Archarodim (will stop to be personal once I'll add comments and cleaned the code ;) )

Important TODO:

- Add an online help showing the localized readme.txt file (a script on my side will have to encode-escape the text before each commit)
- Make it so the sound will play even if the live-list is disabled.

Other TODO:

- Add something in the readme.txt file about why Decursive changed that much and why one can no longer click in the live-list, it's a recurrent question...
- Make it so that the MUFs can be ordered by Class easily.
- Change the live-list display
- when a mind controlled unit is sheepped we should be able to know it without having to target it and look for the sheep debuff
- Mages should be able to choose what metamorphose spell they want to use
- Add an option to only show the MUF in raid
- Clean up the code
- Add comments
