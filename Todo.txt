TODO:

- change list: name ---> GUID -- DONE
	- add PrioGUIDtoNAME and SkipGUIDtoNAME in profile -- DONE
	- add cleanup function at startup if skipprioGUIDtoNAME is empty and not skip and prio -- DONE
- change raid: arraybyname --> arraybyGuid -- DONE

- use the new guid to unit table everywhere nametounit was used -- DONE

- use UNIT_NAME event to update the old table and trigger class border updates

- add clever update trigger of the MUF
    - class change (see above)
    - Attributes (unitID or spells)
    - Stealth
    - Debuff

- Add a user debuff warning mechanism where you could define debuff names you
  want to be aware of, then Decursive would add a special status, such as a
  little colored triangle in the middle of the MUFs and then you will have to
  create a mouseover macro (using default Blizzard macro interface) and use it on
  the MUF of your choice...

- If the Unstable Affliction is detected on a player, add a warning status if the player can cure magic... (more or less done)

- when a mind controlled unit is sheepped we should be able to know it without having to target it and look for the sheep debuff
  (maybe just check for polymorph debuff/buff? on the target and remove the charmed bit if found)

- Mages should be able to choose what polymorph spell they want to use
  (just change the table DcrC.SpellsToUse and call Dcr:Configure();)

- Add an option to let the user choose the alert sound.
