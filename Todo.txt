Always submit clean and fully commented code, if what you want to do requires big changes, ask to the author first.

TODO:

- Add a user debuff warning mechanism where you could define debuff names you
  want to be aware of, then Decursive would add a special status, such as a
  little colored triangle in the middle of the MUFs and then you will have to
  create a mouseover macro (using default Blizzard macro interface) and use it on
  the MUF of your choice...

- If the Unstable Affliction is detected on a player, add a warning status if the player can cure magic...

- when a mind controlled unit is sheepped we should be able to know it without having to target it and look for the sheep debuff
  (maybe just check for polymorph debuff/buff? on the target and remove the charmed bit if found)

- Mages should be able to choose what polymorph spell they want to use
  (just change the table DcrC.SpellsToUse and call Dcr:Configure();)

- Add an option to let the user choose the alert sound.

- Clean up the code (for Archarodim)

- Add comments (for Archarodim)
