TODO:

- change timers when mass debuff so that only the 5 or so first units of the array get updated in priority all the rest should be handled by the roaming MUF updater

- change raid# of player to 'player' when using priolist

- Add a menu option to choose between available spells. (will also allow to choose other polymorph spells)

- Add Cleansing Totem for shaman when the above point is done

- use UNIT_NAME event to update the old table and trigger class border updates

- see table.wipe() to limit garbage

- add clever update trigger of the MUF
    - class change (see above)
    - Attributes (unitID or spells)
    - Stealth
    - Debuff

- Add an option to disable spell stopping when clicking on a MUF

- Add an option to automatically focus sheeped/cycloned units (if no other focus)

- Add a user debuff warning mechanism where you could define debuff names you
  want to be aware of, then Decursive would add a special status, such as a
  little colored triangle in the middle of the MUFs and then you will have to
  create a mouseover macro (using default Blizzard macro interface) and use it on
  the MUF of your choice...

-/ when a mind controlled unit is sheepped we should be able to know it without having to target it and look for the sheep debuff
  (maybe just check for polymorph debuff/buff? on the target and remove the charmed bit if found) ----> or focus it...

- Add an option to let the user choose the alert sound.
