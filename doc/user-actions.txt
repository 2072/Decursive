Decursive, user possible actions
--------------------------------

*How to use Decursive at the maximum of its possibilities*

- **Remove afflictions:**
    
    - Using the [MUFs][]:

	    If you've displayed the Micro-Unit-Frame (on by default) you can click on
	    the micro-frames to *cure, target or focus*.

    - Using the [mouse-over macro][]:

	    A special macro created and maintained by Decursive automatically.
	    (see the link above for more details)

- **Choose who your want to cure** and their priority:

    You can easily **organize the micro-unit frame order** by using the **priority** and
    **skip** list, clicking on the buttons in the Decursive bar (These list can *also*
    be displayed by *Ctrl-Left-Clicking* and *Shift-Left-Clicking* on the [MUF][] handle or on Decursive **Mini-Map Icon**).

    These lists allow you to **dynamically sort** the members of your raid or
    group per **class**, **raid group** or **per name**. A typical
    priority list looks like this:

	1. *Your name* (ex: Archarodim) *(You're always the first player displayed)*
	2. *The tank name*
	3. [Priests]
	4. [Paladin]

	    Etc...
    
    The lists Interface allows you to **add, move, delete** entries very easily and intuitively.

    That's why **Decursive doesn't need to display the player names on the MUF interface**:
    The more the player is high in the window the more important it is to cure him as quickly as possible.

    **You just need to click on the MUF. No time or thoughts are wasted
    reading a player name and choosing if you have to cure him or not.**
	
- **Set Decursive's interface to feet your needs:**

    - **The main 'Decursive bar' and the live-list:**
	
	    This bar is the anchor of the live-list, it can also be used to access
	    Decursive options and different frames.

	    *Middle-Clicking* or *Ctrl-Left-Clicking* on the label "Decursive" will hide
	    the buttons and lock the frame and the live-list position.
	    *Alt-Click* to move the bar and the live-list.

	    Once you've placed the bar at a position you like you can **hide it**
	    completely clicking on the **'X'** button.

	    Various options exists to customize how the live-list behaves.

    - **The** [MUFs][] **window**:

	    You can change almost *every aspects* of this window **(Size, Shape,
	    Colors, Behavior, opacity, spacing, etc...)**, just look in the options.

	    **Move the MUF window** by *Alt-Left-clicking* above the first MUF, there is a
	    hidden **handle** to move the frame.
 
- **WoW key binding interface:**

	You can bind a lot of things to keys under "Decursive" section.
 
- **The option menu:**

    There are **several ways** to access the options:
 
     - On the MUFs handle, or on Decursive icon (Mini-Map or LDB), *Alt-Right-Click*
       to display a **static option panel**. (Or type /DcrOptions in the chat window)
     - In Blizzard Interface->Addons panel, there is a Decursive section.
 
    Each options has an explanation tool-tip, here are **the most important ones**:

    - **Bind Decursive [mouse-over macro][] to a key:**

	    Hitting the bound key will cure the unit under your mouse pointer (the
	    key alone is the first spell, use *Ctrl+key* for the 2nd spell and *shift* for
	    the third)

    - You can **choose what you want to cure** and the **priority**
      of **each affliction type**, the priority determines what affliction is shown
      first (in the live-list) but also the key and click mapping of your spells in
      the MUFs and in the [mouse-over macro][] (look at the tool-tips to know the
      current bindings)
 
    - You can **add afflictions** to ignore while in combat (or always) per
      **class**, it **avoids to waste time and mana** ; Decursive already has
      a comprehensive affliction list ignored on specific classes. 

	    The addition of affliction names is **easily done** through a dynamic menu in the
      options listing recently cured ones *(no need to manually enter the affliction
      name)*

    - You can **display a fake affliction** to set and place the different aspects
      of Decursive's interface when a real affliction is detected.

    - Change the way and where Decursive displays its various messages.

    - You can **save your settings** per character/server/class
      and create custom option profiles.
