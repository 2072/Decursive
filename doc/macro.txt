Decursive's Macro
=================
 
Decursive also creates and maintains (for all your characters) a macro that
allows you to cure units (or other unit-frames) you mouse-over, *you choose the
key in Decursive's options*.

Hitting the key alone will try to cast the first spell, *Ctrl-hitting*, the
second and *shift-hitting* will try to cast the third. Decursive will show you
if the unit beneath your cursor is afflicted by something through its
*live-list* and a sound.
 
**NOTE:** To change the key, use the drop-down option menu, it is accessed
by right-clicking the handle or the "Decursive" bar. You can also use the
command line for example, "/dcr macro SetKey V" will set the new key to [V].
