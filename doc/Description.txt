Decursive key benefits
----------------------

- Ease of use:

    -	Decursive configures itself automatically for your character class, *it works straight out of the box*, no configuration is required.
    -	Intuitive interface and detailed options, Decursive is suitable for simple usage and power users.

- Control what and who you want to dispel:

    -   Easily **Filter out** debuffs you don't want or that are useless to remove by class (*some are pre-configured*).  
	(Such as afflictions affecting mana on non-mana classes, etc...).
    -   Choose between what you can dispel (magic, curses, poison, diseases, charms) choosing their priority.
	(this allows you to share the cleansing work with other players effectively)
    -   Prioritize or exclude members.
	(keep players, classes, or raid groups in a specific order to cleanse them in order of importance)

- Manage Mind controlled units:

    -   If you are a Mage or a Druid you can Polymorph/Cyclone mind-controlled players.
    -	In any case Decursive will allow you to target mind controlled units easily.
    -	Decursive supports magic charming affect removal for Shamans (*Purge*), Priests (*Dispel Magic*),
	Hunters (*Tranquilizing Shot*), and Warlocks (*Fellhunter and Doomguards spells*).

- Don't waste time:

    -   Your cleansing spell Cooldown is displayed to maximize your dispel speed.
    -   An automatic blacklist will prevent you from loosing time on players that cannot be dispelled.  
	(player 'out of line of sight' for example).
    -	Decursive choose a logical cleansing order depending on your current position in the raid.  
	(preventing dispel concurrence between players and thus 'nothing to dispel' messages)
    	
- React faster:

    -   Visual and/or auditive alerts when someone needs your attention and can be dispelled.
    -   Special sound alert when *Unstable Affliction* is detected and you're about to dispel it.
    -   Visual and autitive alert when your dispel attempts are resisted or fail.

- Integration in any interface:

    -	Decursive is designed to save screen real estate and to be forgotten when not needed.
    -	Many options allow you to customize Decursive appearance and interface behavior.
    -	All Decursive alert colors can be modified making it suitable for color-blind people.

- Highly optimized and effective coding:

    -	Decursive was developed with memory and CPU usage in mind, **installing Decursive won't affect your frame rate even in the worst battle conditions**.
    -   Bug free: bugs are not tolerated in Decursive.  
  
  
In brief, what you get with Decursive is **effectiveness**, *a player using Decursive will always dispel faster than other players*.
