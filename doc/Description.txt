Decursive key benefits
----------------------

- **Ease of use:**

    -	Decursive configures itself **automatically** for your character class, *it works straight out of the box*, no configuration is required.
    -	Intuitive interface and detailed options, Decursive is suitable for simple usage and power users.

- Control **what and who** you want to dispel:

    -   Easily **Filter out** afflictions you don't want to cure or that are useless to remove by class (*some are pre-configured*).  
	(Such as afflictions affecting mana on non-mana classes, etc...).
    -   **Choose** between what you can dispel (**magic, curses, poison, diseases, charms**) choosing their priority.
	(this allows you to *share* the cleansing work with other players effectively)
    -   **Prioritize** or exclude members.
	(keep players, classes, or raid groups in a specific order to cleanse them in order of importance)

- **Manage Mind controlled units:**

    -   If you are a Mage, a Druid or a Shaman you can *Polymorph/Cyclone/Hex* mind-controlled players.
    -	In any case Decursive will allow you to target mind controlled units easily.
    -	Decursive supports **magic charming affect removal** for Shamans (*Purge* and *Hex*), Priests (*Dispel Magic*),
	Hunters (*Tranquilizing Shot*), and Warlocks (*Fellhunter and Doomguards spells*).

- **Don't waste time:**

    -   Your cleansing spell **Cooldown** is displayed to maximize your dispel speed.
    -   An **automatic blacklist** will prevent you from loosing time on players that cannot be dispelled.  
	(player 'out of line of sight' for example).
    -	Decursive choose a **logical cleansing order** depending on your current position in the raid.  
	(preventing dispel concurrence between players and thus 'nothing to dispel' messages)
    	
- **React faster:**

    -   **Visual** and/or **auditive** alerts when someone needs your attention and *can* be dispelled.
    -   Special sound alert when *Unstable Affliction* is detected and you're about to dispel it.
    -   Visual and auditive alert when your dispel attempts are *resisted or fail*.

- **Integration in any interface:**

    -	Decursive is designed to **save screen real estate** and to be forgotten when not needed.
    -	Many options allow you to customize Decursive appearance and interface behavior.
    -	All Decursive alert colors can be modified making it suitable for color-blind people.

- **Highly optimized and effective coding:**

    -	Decursive was developed with **memory and CPU usage** in mind, **installing Decursive won't affect your frame rate even in the worst battle conditions**.
    -   Bug free: **bugs are not tolerated in Decursive**.  
  
  
In brief, what you get with Decursive is **effectiveness**, *a player using Decursive will always dispel faster than other players*.
